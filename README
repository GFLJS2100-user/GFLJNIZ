IBNIZ-js WebGL by uones, forked from IBNIZ-js by asiekierka

What is it?

IBNIZ stands for Ideally Bare Numeric Impression giZmo.
It is a virtual machine designed for extremely compact low-level audiovisual programs, 
that use short one letter commands operating on stack and results get out as audio and visual.

This implementation is a fork of asiekierka's ibnjs (IBNIZ-js) app that simulates IBNIZ vm in browser 
(original idea and C implementation created by Viznut).
You can check included examples and experiment with programs.

Main goals of that project:
To make it faster and available under browser.
Checking that WebGl good for that kind tasks.
It still have bugs - some programs dont workp properly

Usage:
Open index.html from local files in compatible WebGL browser

You can also open it directly from github:
https://uones.github.io/ibnjs/index.html

To automatically start your IBNIZ program from link,  pass it URL encoded in c parameter, like:
http://cdn.rawgit.com/uones/ibnjs/master/index.html?c=wor

Compatibility:
Mozilla (Windows 7)
Chrome (Windows 7)
Chrome (Android 4.4) - no Audio

Not working on:
IE 11 (Windows 7)
Samsung H6400 Smart TV browser
Android 4.4 Browser - no WebGL

List of more important changes:
- Made it faster, faster, faster ...
- Moved to WebGL rendering with YUV shader, rendering optimizations
- Dropped eval opcodes optimization for more compact raw functions array
- Fixed some Instruction Pointer operations issues
- Slightly fixed audio for tested browsers
- audio pipeline optimizations
- heavy code, opcodes, and other optimizations
- added Fullscreen mode
- Slightly modified UI
- URL c parameter for passing IBNIZ code in URLs.
